# ✨ Getting started with web dev: building your first portfolio

Hey there! 👋 So you want to learn web development, but don't know where to start? Worry not, we are here to guide you through the practicalities of web dev by teaching you the fundamentals of HTML/CSS!

Being comfortable with the fundamentals will allow you to pick up popular front-end frameworks (e.g. React, Angular, Vue) with more ease. You will come out of this workshop with a portfolio which you can further enhance to showcase your skills to recruiters or future employers!

## Pre-workshop checklist
- [ ] **A text editor** to write code: there are many options out there, we recommend **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** as it has some good extensions that would make your coding experience a lot better. _Setting up VS Code is a breeze, see our instructions below_
- [ ] **A web browser**, to test code in. (e.g. **Chrome - Recommended**, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.)

#### Optional (but highly recommended) VS Code Setup
_:clock1: Estimated setup time: 5-7 minutes_
- [ ] Install VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ ] Install our recommended extensions: (_You can simply click on the link provided, then click on the green **install** button. For more detailed steps, see our guide to installing VS Code Extensions below this section_)
    - Install the Live Server extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - this will enable instant browser reload with changes to your code, without you having to hit save to see your changes on the browser.
    - Install the Live Share extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) - this will allow you to share your code with us if you ever need help :)
        - Note that for this extension, you will need either a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-ie) account to login to begin any Live Share sessions.
    - Install the Beautify extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) so that your HTML/CSS code can be automatically formatted ✨
    
#### Quick guide to installing VS Code Extensions

1. Navigate to the online Marketplace link we provided for the Live Server extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
2. Click on "Install"

3. You will be prompted from your browser to allow VS Code to be opened to continue the installation
4. When the extension is opened on VS Code, click on "Install".

5. Upon successful installation of this extension, you will see this message next to the uninstall button: `This extension is enabled globally`. Voilà, you're all set!

An alternate way of installing extensions is by searching up the extension you want to install on VS Code directly, from the `Extensions` view <img width="49" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-01 at 11 39 45 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38872354/97812579-f211da00-1c36-11eb-8175-8da1d479e21c.png">

You can search up the extension, then follow steps 4-5 above to proceed with the installation.
